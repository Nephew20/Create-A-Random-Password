# Create-A-Random-Password 

## Description

Security as defined by Merriam Webster, is the quality or state of being secure from dangers. A sub definition states that it is something that secures, as in the form of protection. Protecting things that an individual views as valuable is rarely possible to quantify with words, but is a common practice in everyday life. A common form of securing private information is in the form of a password. From logging into your bank acounts to adding apps onto your mobile device, passwords are used to guard and ensure that personal information is only accessible to the individual. But what if someone learns your password? Browsers such as Google, have a feature that will generate a random password password, making harder for someone to get your password. This program is similar to that feature.
